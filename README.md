# Simultaneous Min Max Algorithm
This repo presents a Python implementation of the Simultaneous Minimum and Maximum algorithm. 

This algorithm is an efficient technique for finding the minimum and maximum values in a array, optimizing the number of comparisons.

## The recursion behind the algorithm
To understand the recursion behind the algorithm, I did some studying and compiled my research in the [min-max-study](docs/min-max-study.md) file.

After studying the algorithm a little, I implemented the algorithm in Python. I also **added comments to the code** to make it easier to understand each step of the algorithm.

## How to run the project in Python üêç
The Simultaneous Min Max algorithm, implemented in Python, can be found in [main.py](code/main.py) file. You can download it if you want to run it on your computer.

This guide assumes you already have Python installed on your computer, ok? ‚úÖ

### Step 1: open your terminal üñ•Ô∏è
First, you need to open a command-line interface.

### Step 2: navigate to the correct folder üìÇ
You must tell the terminal where your `main.py` file is located. You'll use the `cd` (change directory) command for this. Find the path to the folder containing the `main.py` file you downloaded from this repo.

Type cd followed by a space and the path to your folder. Example:

`cd Folder1/Folder2/Folder3/MyProject`

### Step 3: run the file ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
Once you are in the correct folder, you can run the Python script. Type python followed by the name of your file. Example:

`python main.py`

Enjoy your numbers!

## Algorithm analysis
After studying the algorithm and implementing the code in Python, it is time to understand the complexity of the algorithm! You can find the full analysis in the [min-max-analysis](docs/min-max-analysis.md) file.
